### Problems Faced. üöß

- The main problem was how to make the radio buttons look like the design. After searching and playing around for sometime I had two methods.

  - Method 1: Visually-hide the radio button and style the _label_ to look like the radio button. Based on the radio button's focused or checked state, the label can be styled.

    ```css
    .radio-button:focus-visible + .radio-label {
      outline: 0.125rem dotted var(--clr-primary-400);
      outline-offset: 0.125rem;
    }

    .radio-button:checked + .radio-label {
      color: var(--clr-primary-600);
      background-color: var(--clr-primary-400);
    }
    ```

  - Method 2: Visually-hide the label and style the _radio button_ to get the desired look. With this approach I had to use an absolutely positioned pseudo element to display the number in the middle of each radio button.
    ```css
    .radio-button::after {
      content: attr(value);
      position: absolute;
      top: 50%;
      left: 50%;
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    }
    ```

- I ended up using the first method.
